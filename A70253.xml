            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had the honour laſt to wait upon your Lorſhip in your own Palace at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> you was pleaſed to ſignifie ſuch an approbation of this Diſcourſe, as to command from me a Copy of it, which when underſtood by ſome other Perſons of no ſmall acount, I was vigorouſly preſs'd by them to make it Publick, they hoping thereby ſome
<pb facs="tcp:39878:3"/>good might accrew to that Church, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of which your Lordſhip bears ſo conſiderable a ſhare to ſo good purpoſes: And being not willing to ſhun any opportunity whereby I might ſerve the Publick, obey your Lordſhip, and give contentment to my Friends, I buckled my ſelf preſently to a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of it in order to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>And now, ſuch as it is, I preſent to your Lordſhip, deſiring that as it derived the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of appearing abroad from your Lordſhips good liking of it, ſo it may receive Protection from your Lordſhips Power and Authority. For Diſcourſes of this nature, if they be not well fortified, your Lordſhip knows are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaſted by ſoul Reproaches, and unworthy Reflections either upon the Authors or the Principles; and what men want in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Proof, they uſually make up in Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and unjuſt Imputations. And truly, had I not had a greater value for Truth, for the
<pb facs="tcp:39878:3"/>Peace and Settlement of the Kingdom, for the proſperous and quiet Reign of our Great Maſter the King, then I have for mine own Eſteem and Reputation, among ſome ſorts of people, I would never have made my first Eſſay in Publick of ſo ungrateful a nature, as I know this must needs be to many men.</p>
            <p>But we are to conſider we were not born for our ſelves, and ſo that the Cauſe of God may be carried on, the Interest of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion maintained. I think every man ought to make a venture of all that is near and dear to him, and think himſelf very happy, if, with the loſs of all, he can be ſerviceable to ſo great and good Purpoſes: A thing which we whoſe years have not been multiplied to the number of your Lordſhips, have very great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do, both from your Lordſhips Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and many other worthy Perſons in the late bad Times, who, to defend the Principles ſtated and recommended in this Diſcourſe,
<pb facs="tcp:39878:4"/>ſuffered you Selves to be ſtript of all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Comforts which Philoſophers tell us have a very great ſhare, in contributing to our happineſs while we are here. But now as God hath been pleaſed to reſtore the Church to its ancient Conſtitution, and your Lordſhip, and many other eminent Sufferers, not onely to its Wealth and Revenue, but its Defence and Support; ſo I pray God it may continue with the advantage of ſuch Lights as long as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> endure. For 'tis plain, take away the Church, and deſtroy the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which it is ſetled, and we introduce all diſorder and confuſion into the World imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and every man turns Reformer, and every week preſents us with a new Model, vainly boasting it ſelf fetched out of the Old Goſpel, which of how diſmal conſequence to Religion, and to civil Societies, is no difficult thing to judge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39878:4"/>
            <p>But that ſuch a Deſolation may never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Church again, thanks be to God, hath been the care of this preſent Parliament, in ſeveral Acts framed on purpoſe; is the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and care of your Lordſhip, and ſeveral others of great worth and moment, and ſhall, I aſſure you, be the daily Prayer (as indeed it ought to be of every good man) of him,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a very wiſe return that a Reverend Divine, now in being, made, when the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> was framing; Who being asked, <hi>What he intended to do:</hi> Anſwered, <hi>That if the Act was tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he would comply;</hi> and the reaſon was, becauſe he dreaded Faction, not knowing when once he got into it, how far it would drive him, meaning, I ſuppoſe, that when men once come to think themſelves hardly and unkindly treated by their Governors, and ſee the Encouragements of the Nation diſpoſed of to others, whom they think not ſo truly worthy as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; this works ſuch a diſcontent in them, as diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:39878:6"/>them to any Action or Opinion, whereby they may keep at the greateſt diſtance from the Commands of Governors, and expreſs their hatred both to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Authority.</p>
            <p>And, truly Sir, we have ſadly ſeen this thing, that be feared of himſelf, come to paſs in many others, and thoſe who ſome years agone conteſted with the ſpirit of Separation, and both preached and wrote vigorouſly againſt the Principle from whence it took its birth and being, and denounced the heavieſt Curſes both of Heaven and Earth againſt all thoſe who were Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Promotors of it; and now (I am afraid too much thorough a ſpirit of diſcontent and anger at the Government under which they live) baptized into the ſame Principles, and become Examples of the ſame Separation, which they condemned ſo violently, and with ſo great an heat in others, and cannot be content onely to meet and gather people from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quarters both of City and Countrey, but they muſt chooſe the ſame time with thoſe who are the onely le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally conſtituted Preachers; and that is not all, but they pitch in thoſe places, and plant themſelves in thoſe ſtreets, where they acknowledge the Pariſh Miniſter is worthy and laborious, and where they know there is Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity betwixt both the Paſtor and his People.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39878:6"/>
            <p>And what this looks like, but revenge againſt the Government, and an obſtinate reſolution to do what in them lies to undermine the preſent Miniſtry, I cannot tell; a thing which I am ſure the <hi>Puritans</hi> of old, whom they pretend to be followers of, would have diſowned, and vehemently declaimed againſt.</p>
            <p>Sir, The ſad and ſerious conſideration of this, was one occaſion of bending my thoughts upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subject, after you had been pleaſed to give me an invitation to appear in ſo honourable and judicious an Aſſembly. And, in earneſt, he that conſiders well what muſt needs be the Conſequences of all this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, be muſt neceſſarily vindicate any honeſt-hearted and true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> that ſtands up, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power he is inveſted with, endeavours to put a ſtop to theſe irregular proceedings. And thoſe men who, notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid or urged to them from their former profeſſed and avowed Practices and Principles, will yet ſo far countenance their rage and prejudice, as to continue in this unſeaſonable and irreligious Schiſme, I dare tell them, that they are making Rods for, and putting Weapons into their Adverſaries hands, wherewith to fight againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>And if they would but impartially look back upon the late bad Times, and conſider when they had
<pb facs="tcp:39878:7"/>thrown down the Churches Walls and Fences, what was the natural product of thoſe Principles by which they found ſo great fault with, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Conſtitutions and Injunctions of our Church, and how quickly the Wars and furious Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of Separation (raiſed and occaſioned by thoſe Principles) flowed in upon them to their total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and deſtruction. I am confident, if they be not reſolved upon Ruine, it would either bring them back to an honeſt and juſt compliance with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Church, or elſe make them more modeſt in their diſſenting from us.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, if any man ſhall be provoked againſt me for this plain and honeſt dealing both here and in the ſubſequent Diſcourſe, I have no more to ſay, but that I am reſolved to be patient under his Cenſures: He ſhall be the object of my Pity, the ſubject of my Prayers, but not mine anger; and to this purpoſe, I ſhall onely deſire that I may be furniſhed with ſome good degrees and proportions of that excellent meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingenuity, of that admirable candor &amp; oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs, which I have alwayes found both in your Self, and in the ſeveral worthy Branches of your Family, by which you have, and alwayes ſhall engage to any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice him,</p>

            <p>THe Honour and Reputation of the Chriſtian Religion are things which every man ought to be tender of, careful to maintain, and forward to ſpread and propagate abroad: and he that does anything, and lives in the omiſſion of any Duty, whereby it is eclipſed or darkned, whereby ſtanders-by have any occaſion either to think amiſs, or to ſpeak evil and reproachful words of it; he acts neither according to thoſe Obligations that in Baptiſm he laid upon himſelf, nor any wayes in correſpondence to the intrinſick worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the thing it ſelf: For Religion having ſo near a relation to the Soul, and being ſo immediately conducive to the true and proper intereſt of it; it ought to be every mans care to carry himſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39878:8"/>and becoming of it. Now among many other things whereby this admirable contrivance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did at firſt thrive and proſper, and obtain ſuch a general footing in the Eaſtern parts of the World, you ſhall find this one (to wit) the peaceable and obedient carriage of thoſe who were its firſt Votaries to their Governors, and thoſe who were ſet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over them, their readineſs to execute their Commands, their willingneſs to undergotheir Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and their Puniſhments; their Patience under all thoſe Afflictions their Profeſſion did expoſe them to, did hugely recommend the Doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to many that ſtood gazing upon them, and engaged them in a ſtudying of, and afterwards in an hearty complyance with that which was attended with ſo rare and excellent, with ſo unfrequent and ſo unknown a temper. And when Chriſtians loſt this ſpirit, and began to diſpute it with their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors at firſt with words, and afterwards with blows; when, inſtead of the meekneſs and patience of their Anceſtors, they were cloathed with the revenge and malice, with the cruelty and bitterneſs of laſps'd and apoſtatized Spirits, and every little fancyed Provocation put them upon plotting miſchief, and overturning Governments, why then this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable product of Divine Wiſdom (I mean Religion)

            <p>And how much this Nation peculiarly hath gained by the late unhappy Breaches and unnatural War in this particular, pray let the actions and common carriage of the Inhabitants give evidence: And if Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, if an increaſe of all manner of wickedneſs be any way for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and advancement of Religion, then indeed we have cauſe to be thankful for the ſpirit of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion; but if the contrary (as no one of common ſenſe or reaſon can doubt) then we have all cauſe to bewail it, and endeavour for the future the prevention of it. And truly I know no other nor better way, then mens hearkening to Reaſon, and diſcharging themſelves of thoſe fond Notions, and groundleſs Perſwafions, whereby they are drawn into a liking and allowance of ſuch dangerous and diſturbing Principles: And that I might contribute to ſo good and neceſſary a work, I have made choice of theſe words, <hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to Pincipalities, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the treating upon which words, I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>

               <item>2. What things we are to refuſe Obedience in. For 'tis poſſible for a Magiſtrate to command unlawful things, ſuch as he hath no right to impoſe, and we no liberty, without violating the Injunctions of an higher Prince, and ſo conſequently contracting guilt upon the Conſcience to comply withall.</item>
               <item>3. We will conſider by what wayes we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Duty in both theſe reſpects.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. If we would be ſatisfied what things exact our Obedience; I anſwer, all Lawful and honeſt things, ſuch as have a foundation both in the general and particular Precepts of holy writ. Or elſe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as have no contradiction to them; then farther, if we would know in what things we are not in an active manner to obey our Superiors in, that may be quickly underſtood, to wit, in ſuch things as are as certainly moral Evils, as Obedience to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a real good; and if we barely doubt, and are not as well ſatisfied of the real tuipitude and evil of a thing commanded, as we are that Obedience to Authority is good, then we ſtand obliged to obey; and he that upon this Principle does refuſe, he lays no foundation for a good and comfortable account at the laſt day in the other world.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:39878:9"/>
            <p n="1">1. We are to obey Magiſtrates in all Lawful and honeſt things, ſuch as have a foundation both in the general and particular Precepts of holy Scripture; and though Obedience to ſuch Commands is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply fetch'd from the Authority of the Magiſtrate, but the Authority of God, yet we may juſtly ſay the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates interpoſal ſtrengthens the Obligation, and the neglect or contempt of the Law under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances introduces a greater blemiſh into, and fixes a deeper ſtain upon the Soul. And though he ſins ſeverely that breaks ſo much as we are obliged to keep of the Sabbath, notwithſtanding the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fourth Commandment; yet the ſin is heightned if he break the Sabbath after ſtrict Laws of Authority ſuper-added thereunto; becauſe the Principles from whence ſo great an affront to Laws do flow are more bold and daring, and the contempt is offered as well to the viſible, as the Power that is inviſible; and the man ſins as well in the face of preſent puniſhment, as of future pain and torment; and he offends not onely the Law by which the Command is bound upon us, but the great Law too, by which he is ſo ſtrictly enjoyned to obey thoſe that are ſet over us. And therefore conſider thus much, that though Drunkenneſs and Swearing, Fornication and Adultery, and ſuch other notorious Impieties are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39878:10"/>ſeverely forbidden by God in Scripture, and upon that ſcore lay us under an Obligation to crucifie all thoſe luſts that diſpoſe and incline us thereunto: Yet we act under further preſſures to abſtain from them, and that from the Laws of Man, which if we do offend, we contract a greater guilt, and do pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute our Souls with a more ſpreading and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating filth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to obey Magiſtrates as well in thoſe things that have no contradiction in them to the Commands of holy Scripture; an aſſertion, which if but well weighed, and rightly underſtood, would ſilence many of thoſe unhappy Differences that are now abroad, and pleaded for with ſo great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream a paſſion. The Word of God, as to many things, hath onely given us the Rules of Duty in general, and left the preciſe and particular determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of things as they relate to the ſeveral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Societies, and Bodies Politick, to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours under whom we live. And indeed had God in the holy Scripture determined every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular carriage in all thoſe various relations in which we ſtand, had He reſolved that no one thing ſhould ever be done, no attempt ſhould be made, no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize ſet upon, no deſign purſued without a particular encouragement, and allowance from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39878:10"/>ſome particular Command in Scripture, the Bible certainly muſt have ſwelled up into a Volume too big for moſt to buy, and for men of buſineſs to conſult and read. And therefore, He having given Men rational Souls, capable of prudential and wiſe Conſiderations, He was pleaſed, in many things, to preſcribe our Duties to us in general, and leave the particular accommodation of them to thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules, to our own prudence and diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to our own honeſty and fidelity; and though He enjoyns us to live ſoberly, yet he does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the fixt meaſures of Meat and Drink beyond which we are bound not to go, but He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes us ſo wiſe, or at leaſt that we ought to be ſo, as by reflecting upon the temperature of our Bodies, to know what is moſt conducive to our health, and to order our ſelves accordingly: And though He enjoyn us to live righteouſly, yet He does not tell us of all the Rules and Meaſures of exact juſtice between man and man, but leaves them to the legal conſtitution of a Nation to decide. And when He commands us, by the Apoſtle, to let all things be done decently and in order in the Service of God, He does not make ſuch a particular Deſcription of thoſe things in which that order and decency does conſiſt, as He did under the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39878:11"/>conſidering that the Goſpel was not to be confined to one Nation or People, as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and that the Cuſtoms of Countries alter the ſeveral notions of decency and order: The Goſpel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, being deſigned to be oecumenical and diſperſed over the face of the whole Earth, He left the Determinations of theſe outward circumſtances to the Governors of thoſe ſeveral places. And though I know ſome men look upon this aſſertion as an impeachment of the faithfulneſs of Chriſt, and that if this be true, have the confidence to affirm, That <hi>Moſes</hi> did in point of Truſt excel him; yet he that ſhall conſider what it is that the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5, 6. in that ſo often miſ-quoted and miſ-interpreted place does mean; namely, his compleat fulfilling the Office of a Mediator, he will quickly find that Chriſt looſes nothing of his Supremacy and Praero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, of his Soveraignty and Dominion by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces care, that men do not addreſs themſelves to God in a rude and diſorderly manner; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we may well look upon this power we give to the civil Magiſtrate, as no abridgment of the juſt Power of this great Prince the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> till theſe men who raiſe this Objection can produce a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own ſo modelled by plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced Scripture, as to have nothing of humane
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39878:11"/>counſel and prudential determination in it, till they can bring us out a Draught ſo exactly to the Pattern in the Mount, that Humane Invention is not concerned in one ſtroke or line of it; and truly until this be done, I think the quarrel againſt the innocent Conſtitutions of our Church is unjuſtly maintained.</p>
            <p>Now it being ſo that God hath entruſted Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with ſuch a Power, we muſt have a very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care how we part with the Duty of Obedience to thoſe who are our Rulers. If the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be not in plain down-right terms, or by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and eaſie conſequence, oppoſite to the Word of God, the Rule of our Faith and Manners; if there do not appear in them ſome real turpitude and filthineſs, ſome immorality and natural evil, we muſt conſider well before we ſhake hands, and part with our Governours; for nothing will vindicate our Conſciences at the laſt day, and embolden them to lift up their heads, and plead their cauſe, in caſe of non-obedience to Authority, but commands bearing a perfect and flat contradiction to the Laws of God; 'twas this made the three Children with ſo great and undiſmayed Countenances enter into the fiery Furnace.</p>
            <pb n="01" facs="tcp:39878:12"/>
            <p>And therefore thoſe men who in compliance with a boundleſs paſſion, or out of diſdain of any particular Perſon, or from a Principle of Pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſit in the higheſt place of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> refuſe to come to the publick and conſtituted places of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; why, theſe men do perfectly affront the Law, and ſet up their own private wills againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; they are real Breakers of the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and Sinners againſt all thoſe Injunctions to Obedience with which both the Old and New Teſtament does abound. And they have no plea commonly for what they do, but what is fetched from thoſe little Magazines which our Gallants are wont to make uſe of for their duelling, and their other Sins; namely, that they cannot do this or that in point of Honour, it is below them to make ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentile condeſcenſions, and the World, forſooth, would laugh at them as arrant Fools, and hen-hearted Perſons, if they ſhould ſubmit. Well, but how ſtrong, and of what force theſe Arguments will be either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a death-bed, or at a ſolemn trial, I leave you all to judge. I am ſure then nothing will bear us out for the contemning of thoſe Laws made by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God's Truſtees and Repreſentatives, but ſome real and apparent evil that was in the matter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39878:12"/>of thoſe Commands; and he that is not as certain of the wickedneſs of the thing impoſed, as he is of the goodneſs of Obedience to Authority, does not deal juſtly and with integrity with his Conſcience, if he diſobeys.</p>
            <p>And truly, I wiſh with all mine heart, that this thing was but well weighed, and thereby better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. I am certain it is a Principle which would very much heal the Breaches, and break down thoſe walls of Separation that are too many and too high amongſt us; it would very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep up the honour and veneration of Authority, and Dignities would be more in eſteem then now they are. The reputation of all good Laws would be in heart, and civil Sanctions would lead a better and more quiet life then now they do, (things very deſirable by every man, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the intereſt of all united and incorporated Bodies whatſoever); for when men once by vertue of their Principles and religious pretences hang looſe to Authority, and entertain mean and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable thoughts of what is prudently thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be enacted into a Law, they alwayes grow (unleſs prevented by an excellent natural diſpoſition) tumultuous and ſeditious, and ſtand ready upon every ſlender <hi>alarum</hi> to beſiege and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39878:13"/>the honour and the quietneſs of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which they live, and ſo they continue, if the natural influence and tendency of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be not prevented, plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting and conſpiring till they have either by the hands of violence forced the enjoyment of their own Fancies, or elſe by the deſtruction of their proper Maſters, uſurped the Throne themſelves.</p>
            <p>And now by what hath been diſcourſed under this firſt Head, you have a direct anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing propounded, to wit, wherein we are not to obey Magiſtrates. If we are verily aſſured that the thing commanded is a real Evil, we are then with all modeſty to with-draw our ſelves from the Command, and with patience to ſuffer the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are laid upon us; and he that does ſo is a good Chriſtian, and a good ſubject, and does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can in the leaſt impeach his Principles, or diſcredit his Profeſſion: For thus did the Primitive Chriſtians of old, and all other good men truly influenced by the Divine Spirit ever ſince.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if men either from a bare jealouſie that the thing commanded is unlawful, or out of revenge, becauſe their own Fancies and Opinions do not take place, and have not a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39878:13"/>countenance and encouragement, do ſpeak evil of Dignities, and whiſper againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by ſly and ſubtile, remote and dark ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, either in Prayer or Preaching convey into the minds of people ſuſpicious thoughts of the Powers that are above them: If in praying for a Princes Reformation, they make ſuch a particular deſcription of his faults, as render him odious to his people; why, theſe men are ſo far from being good Subjects, or good Chriſtians, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be marked out for Firebrands, and kept within bounds, as Perſons whoſe deſign is nothing elſe but Sword and Battel, as men who, like the Diſciples, know not what ſpirit they are of; or elſe if they do, are reſolved to ruine themſelves, provided they can but work the deſtruction of others at the ſame time. A <hi>Principle</hi> ſo far from having any thing that is maſculine and generous, that is Evangelical and Divine in it, that it is raked out of the bottomleſs Pit, and never knew what it was to have a being, till by a voluntary lapſe and fall from <hi>God,</hi> Angels were turned into Devils.</p>
            <p>And now if any man by what hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, is convinced of his Duty of Obedience to God's publick Miniſters and Inſtruments of Juſtice, and is deſirous to underſtand how he may know
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39878:14"/>this Duty, and diſtinguiſh between Commands Lawful, and thoſe that are Unlawful, by reaſon of their being morally evil. I muſt then, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, deſire him to take theſe things along with him by way of caution; which is the third thing propounded to be diſcourſed of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he never judge of any thing commanded by his Rulers, by thoſe odious and ſcandalous titles men of perverſe and refractory ſpirits fix upon it, but let him bring the thing to a ſetled and appointed Rule, and according to its agreement or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that, either cloſe with it, or elſe ſhun it, for they are Rules preſcribed by God the great Law-Maker, by which we muſt be judged at the laſt day; and therefore they are the ſame Rules by which our Actions muſt be regulated. It hath been a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way you know to revile ſome things that have been enjoyned amongſt us, under the name of Popiſh and Superſtitious; a charge conſidered in it ſelf, and where 'tis truly laid, very weighty and worthy of every mans thoughts and care. For to call and aſſert a thing Popiſh and Superſtitious, is to àſſert it as a thing having no foundation in Scripture, and yet thruſt and obtruded upon the minds of men; as a neceſſary Article of Faith, a thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and entertained with as true and divine a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39878:14"/>Faith, as any of thoſe Articles which are contained in that which we call the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed; and under this notion do the Papiſts aſſert Tranſubſtantiation, Invocation of Saints, Prayer for the Dead, Purgatory, &amp;c. And he that will not ſwallow theſe down, he is proſcribed and cut off, as a Perſon to whom Satan hath the greateſt right. Now I muſt confeſs, that if any Magiſtrate impoſe any thing that is not either plainly raid down, or eaſily deduced and drawn from the holy Scripture, and under ſuch a ſevere Notion as this, we ſtand no wayes obliged to an active Obedience to his Laws, for therein that ſo often uſed, and ſo very much abuſed Text takes place, <hi>Whether it be better to ſerve God or man, judge ye.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if things commanded by the Authority and Wiſdom of our Governors have no ſuch neceſſity fixt upon them, and are declared to be alterable, and enjoyned onely as they are thought to miniſter to the purpoſes of Order, Decency, and Edification; and are declared to lay no further Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conſcience, then was derived from thoſe Texts of Scripture whereby we are commanded to obey our Governors, I think no wiſe man can juſtly, and upon ſerious thoughts, brand them with the name of Popiſh and Superſtitious.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:39878:15"/>
            <p>For, in a word, the true proper and formal noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Popery, is to force men with the ſame neceſſity to believe and practiſe ſuch things as have no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Scripture, but have been brought into the Church to ſerve the corrupt Humors, the proud Minds, and covetous Deſigns and Intereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they do believe and practiſe: Thoſe things which are plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in holy-Writ, which is certainly an inpairing and dividing the Kingly Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you would know whether a matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be good or evil, and ſo fit for your practiſe or forbearance, look into Scripture impartially, and compare one Text with another, and weight the ſcope and deſign of the Pen-men in thoſe ſeveral places, and be not reſolved to bend and draw them to the Service of any Party or Opinion whatſoever: For this in all Ages hath done much wrong to Truth, and opened the very Floodgates of Diſobedience, and contempt of humane Laws. For inſtance, if a man in order to keep you out of the loving and pleaſant arms of Truth, and to fix you in a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle or Opinion, ſay as the Apoſtle once ſaid, <hi>Come out from among them, and be you ſeparate, and touch no unclean thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17. Or as the ſame Apoſtle in another place, <hi>Touch not, taſte not,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39878:15"/>handle not;</hi> why, your buſineſs is to weigh and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly and deeply to conſider upon what ſcore theſe words were ſpoken, and what it was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſigned to preſerve the people to, whom he wrote from the pollution of; and upon ſearch you will find, that when the Apoſtle cries, <hi>Come out from among them,</hi> he means from the Idolatry of the Heathens; and then you muſt be ſure, that the Church from which you are tempted is as truly Idolatrous as that was out of which the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> or elſe that Scripture will not be a ſufficient warrant for your departure and ſeparation from it. And when the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.20, 21. adviſes them neither <hi>to touch, nor taſte, nor handle,</hi> you will find they were certain Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as abſtaining from Marriage, and ſome ſorts of Meats as utterly unlawful; which though they might be abſtained from, yet when they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden as things deteſtable, and unlawful in their own nature, the Apoſtle tells them, That it is giving away the liberty Chriſt had purchaſed for them; and this Text therefore, as many other which are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to very bad and pernicious purpoſes, will be found to ſtrike indeed at the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, who, as I ſaid before, impoſes upon the minds of men things as abſolutely neceſſary, which have no ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39878:16"/>neceſſity neither in their own nature, nor by vertue of any Command from God; but it reaches not at all any legal Injunction, recommended as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and declared not to change its nature, but that it may be altered and removed out of the way, when the Governor ſees it good ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And truly, if Scripture was but thus weighed, we ſhould ſoon come to an end of moſt of our unhappy Differences, that are now too much alive among us, and then Love and Unity, Amity and Friendſhip, Peace and Good Will, would have a greater room in the World then now they have. But then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is one thing more that I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to every perſons conſideration, and that is when he enquires into the nature of the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in order to his ſatisfaction, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if he enquire after the lawfulneſs or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thoſe three Ceremonies, which are the great ſtones of offence at which ſo many perſons in this Kingdom ſtumble. I deſire him to conſider how doubtful and unſatisfied, how wavering and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved many of thoſe perſons are who are the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of Diſſention from our Church, and moſt ready to form men into Bodies and Parties againſt our ſetled Diſcipline, which to me is a conſideration of no ſmall ſtrength and force. For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39878:16"/>many indiſcreet men, with a very great and raiſed zeal, vent both in Pulpits, and other popular Diſcourſes, their Spleen and Anger againſt theſe Inſtitutions, fixing ſuch names upon them as they know will ſtir the choler of the more rude and ignorant ſort of people, ſuch whereby God in anger repreſents his indignation againſt the Heathen Idols; yet if you come to examine their judgments of theſe things, by ſome other actions, you will find they are not ſo rationally ſatisfied of the unlawfulneſs of theſe things, as by theſe furious Belches they would make the World believe.</p>
            <p>He that conſiders how many of theſe angry men ſtudiouſly and adviſedly educate their Children, in order to the advantages and improvements of an Univerſity-life, where, when they come, they are aſſured they muſt ſwear to obey their Governors and be obſervant of the Statutes; where they know they muſt wear a Surplice, and daily attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Prayers which they load with ſo many vile Reproaches; why, he muſt needs conclude them either men of no Conſcience, that will adviſedly ſend their Children to places, where they muſt certainly ſwear to, and live in the practice of ſuch things as in their own Opinion work in God the greateſt Diſpleaſure and Indignation (which I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39878:17"/>thank God the honour I have for ſeveral Diſſenters, will give me no liberty to credit them, or elſe (which indeed any man may more ſafely incline to) that they are not ſo fully ſatisfied in the Evil of theſe things, as in their tranſports and heats among popular Auditories they would make the World believe.</p>
            <p>And farther, he that looks back upon a very few weeks ſince, and conſiders how many perſons thoroughout this Nation, who were before profeſſed Enemies to our Church, have, in compliance with a late ſeaſonable Law, joyned with us in our Publick Worſhip, and devoutly uſed that Ceremony of kneeling at the Sacrament, which hath been ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly branded by many of their Maſters; that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, I ſay, which is the onely one in which the Laity is concerned; he muſt needs ſay, that theſe are Demonſtrations that neither they nor their Teachers are ſo well convinced of the Evil of theſe things, as they would (I will not judge for what ends) force upon the belief of other men. For if theſe things were ſo concluded, men of Principles and Conſcience would rather looſe their Eſtates and Lives, all that is near and dear to them; then comply; but being nor ſo concluded, we find what little things ſerve to bring them back to our Communion; and ſince
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39878:17"/>they are returned, I pray God keep them there; for I am aſſured they ſtand obliged ſo to do, for no man can withdraw from Obedience, but he that believes the things evil in their own nature that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and he that can once in a year, with a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Conſcience, obey Authority in any one thing commanded, he ſtands bound to do it every day in the year that he is called to expreſs that Obedience: And whoſoever does otherwiſe, he is falſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, and Government hath no ſecurity from a man of ſuch Principles at all. For to come to the legally ſetled places of Worſhip one day, and the next to follow the Camps of Separation, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, is an argument that not ſenſe of Duty, but Humour and Fancy, Paſſion and Intereſt, governs and rules the man; from which government we may all well ſay, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let me intreat thee, whoſoever thou art, when thou takeſt theſe things into thy thoughts, in order to thy ſatisfaction, let theſe actions of men be weighed, and I do not doubt, but then thou wilt equally be inclined to the evidence and fulneſs of the Arguments uſed on both ſides; which if thou art, no queſtion thou wilt be quickly found walking chearfully in the plain and harmleſs road of Duty and Obedience: For I am ſure that Bug-bear words
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39878:18"/>and reproachful Expreſſions have more prevented mens compliance with the Orders of our Church, then ever ſolid Proof and rational Arguments have done. And thus I have briefly diſcourſed the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Obedience, a thing certainly worthy of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans conſideration; let me therefore in a word invite you all, according to thoſe ſeveral Orbs in which you move, and capacities and circumſtances in which you ſtand, to do all that lies in your power to ſpread abroad and propagate theſe Principles. To encourage you to which, I may boldly and yet ſafely ſay, That your Lives and Fortunes, your Liberties, and all other enjoyments lie at ſtake, and are near a ruine, if theſe Principles do not obtain. I liſt not to rake into former Sores, but yet this I will ſay, That from the want of theſe Notions of Obedience, I dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our former Commotions and Diſturbances, and the miſerable conſequences of them which to this day we feel; and he that notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid or felt, will yet hug thoſe two pernicious Principles (for ſo I may well call them) to wit, that the Magiſtrate hath nothing to do in Church affairs, and then that nothing muſt be done in or about Divine Worſhip but what there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Preſcript for in Scripture. I ſay, he that will ſtill hold theſe, I ſay no more, but that I pray God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39878:18"/>the Government of this Nation may never lie at his Feet; that he may alwayes be in Subjection, and never ſit at the Helm; for doubtleſs theſe are Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that do naturally tend to ſet up Fancy againſt Judgment and Reaſon, and to make private ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Interpretations of their own, the ſtandards by which all things in Religion and Worſhip muſt be modelled; and when it comes to this, then farewel all Order and Decency. 'Tis this that breaks Church-windows, and defaces the goodly Monuments of Antiquity: 'Tis this that tears the comly Garments of the Prieſt in pieces, and fixes ſuch odious Names upon that ancient Order of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and after that, calls all Meſſengers of the Goſpel by the names of <hi>Prieſts of Baal,</hi> and <hi>dumb Doggs.</hi> 'Tis this that denies Children their right to the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and laughs at the ſolemn confirmation of them in that Faith, which by their Truſtees they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to maintain and defend. Farther, 'tis this that makes ſuch a noiſe and quoil about the Spirit of Prayer, and will allow nothing to come from God, but what is powred out without any regard to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, or ſenſe of diſtance betwixt the Creator and the Creature: For had Reaſon and unprejudiced Judgment taken place, and Fancy waited upon them according to her bounden duty, we had not been
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39878:19"/>troubled with thoſe ſwarms of Hereſies and poyſonous Opinions that now fly up and down, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of Laws and Government, and to the moleſtation of mens minds and ſpirits, whereby they are taken off from the conſtant and laborious practice of thoſe plain and clear Inſtances and Requiſites of Religion, and hindered from the dutiful and neceſſary proſecution of thoſe Callings and Imployments to which Divine Providence hath fixed them. Nay, in a word, 'tis this which, if it prevail, will at laſt be modelling the Civil Government, and altering that excellent Conſtitution, by which, at ſuch times as theſe, Juſtice is brought to our very doors; for theſe are Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples very buſie and pragmatical, and State as well as Church Affairs muſt be ordered by them. Now therefore, we are all obliged to do what in us lies to ſuppreſs and curb thoſe Principles which give fancy ſo great a ſway, and to ſettle all that belong to our care and charge in theſe generous and catholick notions of Obedience and Subjection; then may we hope to ſit under our own Vines and Figg-trees with delight, then may we expect the return of Primitive Chriſtianty again, wherein Faith and not Faction, Reaſon and not Fancy, internal Holineſs, and not groundleſs and fond Opinions, ſhall prevail and triumph. All which things God of his mercy grant, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom, &amp;c.</p>
